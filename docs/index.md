# Image Classification using Neural Networks


## Introduction

As a milestone in completing my Machine Learning training at Talent Path, our cohort was asked to create a project to showcase our skills within the Machine Learning space. With broad agency as to what sort of technologies to build, I set out to build a project that could showcase my ability to deliver quality product in less than ideal environments. In our training I felt that there was limited amounts of instruction towards nueral networks and image classification. To showcase my ability to learn rapidly and comprehensively, I decided that Image classification would be an excellent problem to challenge.

My project was inspired by Amazon's Go stores that they had opened initially in Seattle, and had expanded to other locations throughout the United States. I remember seeing these stores open up and thinking of how revolutionary the technology was. In Amazon's value proposition of these stores was as follows:


> "What if we could weave the most advanced machine learning computer vision and AI into the very fabric of a store so you never have to wait in line? No lines. No checkouts. No registers."

Combining that inspiration with the practical use cases came to me while talking with Stephen Logan about how Dell operates and what we should expect in our work with Dell.
