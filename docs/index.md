# Image Classification using Neural Networks


## Introduction

As a milestone in completing my Machine Learning training at Talent Path, our cohort was asked to create a project to showcase our skills within the Machine Learning space. With broad agency as to what sort of technologies to build, I set out to build a project that could showcase my ability to deliver quality product in less than ideal environments. In our training I felt that there was limited amounts of instruction towards nueral networks and image classification. To showcase my ability to learn rapidly and comprehensively, I decided that Image classification would be an excellent problem to challenge.
